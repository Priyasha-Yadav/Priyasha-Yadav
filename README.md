# Heya! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Priyasha Yadav
![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=1000&width=435&lines=Welcome+to+my+Github+profile!)

Iâ€™m Priyasha â€” a human being who spends her days turning coffee â˜• into code ðŸ’»... and pretending to know what Iâ€™m doing (but really Googling/ChatGPTing half the time ðŸ¤«). Iâ€™m all about building cool things, usually fueled by a 3 a.m. coding session â€” because who needs sleep when you can write code that *almost* works?âœ¨

When Iâ€™m not busy fixing syntax errors, Iâ€™m diving into the latest AI trends and technology or wondering why my Wi-Fi always fails at the worst possible moment. Letâ€™s connect and make the tech world just a little more fun â€” or at least try to break less stuff along the way! ðŸš€
